# Weather-Classification-Web-App
The main aim of this project is to make a model that correctly classifies the weather states on the images it sees.  This seems pretty easy but the main challenge the model will face is that it doesnâ€™t need to learn about the shapes of the objects in the image, rather it needs to learn about the sky color in the image.

## Make sure import the .h5 model in app.py file for application to run
